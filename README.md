# Overview üìù
Sure, I'd be happy to help with your project overview and answer any questions you have on the topic of active learning. 

**Project Overview:**
The goal of our project is to develop a web application that leverages active learning principles to enhance the learning process. When a PDF document is uploaded to the application, it will automatically generate questions based on the content of the document. Users will be able to interact with these questions, providing answers which will be evaluated by the system to determine correctness. Additionally, the application will provide a summary of the quiz, highlighting key concepts covered in the document.

**Key Features:**
1. PDF Upload: Users can upload PDF documents to the web application.
2. Question Generation: The application automatically generates questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
3. Interactive Quizzing: Users can interact with the generated questions, providing answers.
4. Answer Evaluation: The system evaluates user-provided answers to determine correctness.
5. Summary Generation: The application generates a summary of the quiz, highlighting key concepts covered in the document.

**Benefits:**
- Active Learning: By actively engaging with quiz questions, users can reinforce their understanding of the document's content.
- Efficiency: Research suggests that repeated testing, as opposed to repeated studying, leads to superior transfer of learning. Our application aligns with this principle by providing opportunities for active engagement.
- Accessibility: The web-based nature of the application ensures accessibility across different devices and platforms.

**Target Audience:**
- Students: Our primary target audience includes students looking to enhance their learning experience by actively engaging with course materials.
- Educators: Educators can also utilize the application to create quizzes and assessments based on course materials.

**Research Inspiration:**
Our project was inspired by the research of Donloskey and Andrew C. Butler, which suggests that active learning methods, such as repeated testing, are more efficient than passive learning methods like repeated studying. Institutions such as Stanford, Cambridge, and Harvard have endorsed the use of active learning techniques, further reinforcing the importance of our project's focus on active engagement.

Feel free to ask any questions you have regarding the project or the topic of active learning!
